### American Sign Language Recognizer
The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models.  In particular, this project employs  [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).  In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.

Feature selections:

Model selectors: 
* Cross Validation fold, use sklearn KFold 
* Bayesian information Criterion, use hmmlearn GaussianHMM 
* Discriminative Information Criterion, use hmmlearn GaussianHMM 

Recognizer:

The criteria: correctly recognoze 40+%. The best result achieved is 60%
